## v1.6.1 — Node Capabilities & Background Resilience

> Requires Android 10+ (API 29)

### New Features

- **7 Node Capabilities (15 commands)** — Camera, Flash, Location, Screen, Sensor, Haptic, and Canvas now fully registered and exposed to the AI via WebSocket node protocol
- **Proactive Permission Requests** — Camera, location, and sensor permissions are requested upfront when the node is enabled, before the gateway sends invoke requests
- **Battery Optimization Prompt** — Automatically asks user to exempt the app from battery restrictions when enabling the node

### Background Resilience

- **WebSocket Keep-Alive** — 30-second periodic ping prevents idle connection timeout
- **Connection Watchdog** — 45-second timer detects dropped connections and triggers reconnect
- **Stale Connection Detection** — Forces reconnect if no data received for 90+ seconds
- **App Lifecycle Handling** — Auto-reconnects node when app returns to foreground after being backgrounded
- **Exponential Backoff** — Reconnect attempts use 350ms-8s backoff to avoid flooding

### Fixes

- **Gateway Config** — Patches `/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to clear `denyCommands` and set `allowCommands` for all 15 commands (previously wrote to wrong config file)
- **Location Timeout** — Added 10-second time limit to GPS fix with fallback to last known position
- **Canvas Errors** — Returns honest `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` errors instead of fake success responses
- **Node Display Name** — Renamed from "OpenClaw Termux" to "OpenClawX Node"
